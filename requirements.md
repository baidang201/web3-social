   - Users must be able to like any posted content
   - Users must be able to view like counts for each post
   - Like status must be tracked per user per post
   - Users must not be able to like their own posts

### Data Storage
1. On-chain Storage Requirements
   - All content must be stored on Ethereum blockchain
   - Content must be publicly accessible
   - Content must be retrievable by:
     * Creator address
     * Content ID
     * Timestamp

## Technical Requirements
